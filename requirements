# Requirements for api.buttoncorp.org

1. Way to recieve notification from frontend users (exposed API endpoint, rocket?)
  A. Track a separate randomly-generated cookie to validate single-use as much as possible
2. Way to store responses from each day, and then cache over on new day (local file database preferred, memory database can function)
3. Heartbeat API (for server outage page because funny)
4. Method to alert to discord reports and current usages (webhooks or bot, webhooks probably)

rotate button_pressed cookie, with the date the button started. modify cookie, don't overwrite, set expiration much longer (a week?)
